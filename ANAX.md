Use in Anax
=========

This library was created as a part of the kmom05 in [DV1486 Databased webapplications with PHP and MVC framework](http://edu.bth.se/utbildning/utb_kurstillfalle.asp?lang=en&KtAnmKod=C5403&KtTermin=20142) at Blekinge Institute of Technology.

A part of this task was to include instructions of how to use the library in the Anax-MVC framework used during the course.

I will soon do that...

```php
```
